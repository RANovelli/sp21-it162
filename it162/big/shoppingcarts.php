    <p>In order to sell products online while maintaining orders and providing excellent customer service, a functioning eCommerce website is mandatory. Several years ago, adding a shopping cart to an existing website or blog was very difficult. Today’s shopping cart solutions have considered this confusion by enabling payment processing as a fast and reliable process. Buiderfly.com sums up shopping carts in a nutshell, “An online shopping cart is a software that allows your customers to shop for products from your website. Some basic shopping carts are secure and only include necessary features such as buy now buttons and checkout pages. But some advanced shopping carts go the extra mile and allow you to get benefited from the amazing functionalities like improvement of customer service and other necessary eCommerce tools for your website. (Builderfly.com)” They extrapolate further, maintaining, “A shopping cart is a medium for online store owners to maintain a customer’s purchase journey and buying decision. Based on it, owners can come to know what attracts their customers and what is stopping them from buying a specific product. They can analyze many issues and propose a suitable solution for the customer. (Builderfly.com)”</p>
    <p>Convenience and ease are everything in today’s market. A natural, efficient process will yield more from visitors to your website. One major pitfall can be non-linear checkout processing. Regarding testing done on this subject, Christian Holst on Smashing Magazine points out, “One of the worst usability violations that we discovered in our testing was non-linear checkout processes. Websites with a non-linear checkout process left several of our test subjects confused and intimidated. (Holst)” Shopping carts play a substantial role in converting your online store visitors into customers. Nate Drake, et al, on Tech Radar states, “The best shopping cart software can provide a seamless online retail experience for customers, allowing them to order and pay for products directly from your website. Shopping cart software is therefore essential when it comes to selling online, and is often effectively a shorthand term for an eCommerce platform. However, there are a number of key choices you can make - set it all up yourself, or pay for a ready-made solution. (Drake, et al)”</p>
    <p>If you prefer setting up your own shopping cart software, you'll need eCommerce web hosting in order to cater to your shopping website and ensure you add credit card processing options for payments. Often, people opt for an off-the-shelf solution in which everything is already provided. The upside to this is that everything is already set up for use. The trade-off being that this will likely cost more in the long run than if you manage your own site. Whichever route you choose, shopping carts are an integral part of monetizing your site, and possibly the difference between a flourishing business and one that languishes.</p>
